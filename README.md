# tes4-crash-logger

A DLL that logs crashes for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

---

Fork of Yvile's fork of Cobb's Crash Logger that reimplements some of Yvile's features to provide a far more readable crash log for Oblivion. CrashLogger.log in the root Oblivion folder (next to Oblivion.exe) will now have more information like specific game objects, forms, and classes loaded at the time of the crash.
